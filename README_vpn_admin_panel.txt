VPN Admin Panel - Offline Version
Files included:
- index.html
- chart.js
- jspdf.umd.min.js
- html2pdf.bundle.js
(optional images included)

How to use:
1. Extract the ZIP to a folder.
2. Open index.html in your browser (double-click). The app stores data in browser localStorage.
   - Data is persistent across browser sessions and persists until cleared manually or by browser settings.
3. To host online: upload the files to GitHub Pages or any static hosting.

If you want me to:
- add a tiny server-friendly version,
- set a default logo inside index.html,
- or generate a demo GitHub repo + Pages publish â€” tell me and I will prepare it.
